# Sweeper

This was a project to get my head back in Swift and iOS development by doing a nice simple Minesweeper
implementation.  There's also a shared framework for the game engine, because I was thinking about 
using the game to play with machine learning a little.

As it turns out, it actually provides a halfway passable Minesweeper game...

Remaining tasks include:
- Rendering large numbers of cells is slow (seems to be a problem with UICollectionView)
- Cosmetics are pitiful
- Implement option to flag cells
- Implement user-selectable difficulty
